# What is FairShare?

FairShare is a concept enabled by blockchain technology. Though the technology may seem complicated, the idea is simple: when you contribute to a project, you get to keep a piece of what you put in.

As with any project, there will be people who invest money and people who invest time. Whatever your contribution, you will own your _FairShare_.

# What projects work with FairShare?

A _project_ can be anything - a business, a house, a movie... the FairShare idea works wherever people work together.

# FairShare is a new way to collaborate 

Pretend you're an author and you just finished your first novel. All your friends and family love it. It'll be a bestseller for sure! 







Most people will have heard of _royalties_, which is money given to musicians whenever their song is downloaded. You may also know about _stock options_, which are sometimes offered to a company's employees. In both cases, the people who wrote the song or built the product can show they own a piece of the work they did in the past. They may even make money from their work long after the work is done.

Wouldn't it be great if everyone could do this?

# FairShare is a new way to do business

Let's pretend that you wanted to start a new business. Say there's an empty storefront in your neighbourhood that would be perfect for a candy store. It's a great location right next to a school. Not only will hundreds of children pass by your shop everyday, you know that parents will appreciate the inexpensive novelties that make good birthday presents. 


# FairShare is the difference between a community _taking ownership_ of a project and _owning_ a project.
