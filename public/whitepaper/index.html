        <h1>FairShare: Blockchain Proof of Attribution</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Removing <em>trust</em> in collaborative creative projects by means of Blockchain technology ensures individual participants receive permanent attribution for their contribution to the overall work. Once a contribution is accepted, credit is paid out to the contributor in the form of crypto tokens. These tokens may be used to facilitate smart-contract micropayments, vote on organizational matters, or to enforce proprietary rights, as in a court of law. The possession of digital keys, as they pertain to all common crypto accounts, prove token ownership. Anyone owning a stake in a digital project has the free discretion to market their tokens and any smart-contract royalties to which they may be entitled. The permanent nature of a blockchain makes it the ideal platform for encoding proprietary attribution rights over a digital property.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The concept of digital attribution on the blockchain is not new. Major smart-contract-capable blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Cardano have already deployed specialized <em>Non-Fungible Tokens</em>. NFTs are a popular way to allow digital creators and their fans the opportunity to sell and trade unique, signed pieces of digital art. By themselves, NFTs satisfy the need to prove ownership and attribution. Even the idea of a collaborative blockchain platform is not unique, as evidenced by tokens like <em>GitCoin</em>, which incentivizes contributions made to open-source projects.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>FairShare</em> attribution is unique in that it helps prove proprietary rights while leveraging existing software and platforms to facilitate creative collaboration. In recognition of a contribution, payment is made in the form of <em>FairShares</em>, which are platform-specific tokens that entitle the holder to certain rights enforced by smart-contracts. These rights include the ability to withdraw royalty payments in proportion to the total number of FairShares issued in development of a project, vote in organizational matters, or to assert legal ownership of a digital work in a human court.</p>
<h1>2. Digital Works</h1>
<p>For the purposes of this white paper, discussion will revolve around works of literature, though the FairShare platform is not constrained to this medium. <em>Any</em> digital product can be produced, though books and book publishing are sufficiently complex to draw out important points of discussion.</p>
<p>Though a book is commonly attributed to one author, this is not always the case. Similarly, though a group of individuals may author a book, credit is also due to those who add value to its publication. This includes editors, cover designers, and financial backers like investors or traditional publishing houses. Stake-holders of the resulting digital work may then <em>licence</em> the product to a person or a some other organization. These licencees may then decide to transfer ownership of the associated NFT. In this case, the contributions of all those involved will still be recognized. If royalties result from the sale, FairShare holders are able to withdraw that to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>Access to a digital work may be granted by minting new NFTs. If a digital asset is excessively large, access may (for example) be granted through specialized NFTs which decode a digital stream for the token holder. The manner in which digital work is consumed is decided by its owner. Likewise, access may be granted to project contributors or even purchased with FairShares, regardless of whether they are associated with that particular project.</p>
<h1>3. FairShares</h1>
<p><em>FairShares</em> are the native token of the FairShare platform. Projects vary in size and scope, so there is no upper limit to the number of tokens that might be issued. This is so that there is no limit to the number of people allowed to participate. While book publishing may be complex, it is helpful to contrast the number of people that may be required to produce a video game or movie. Organized to maximize collaboration in this way, development on an artistic franchise may potentially continue while still respecting the work of the original creators. Book series like the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are an example of such a franchise, which, if deployed on the FairShare platform, would entitle the creator's estate to an ongoing share of the royalties through a smart contract rather than a legal firm.</p>
<p>FairShares may entitle the holder access to a digital work, though this is not necessarily true. Access is decided by an NFT's creator or by a vote, where each FairShare provides one ballot. Smart contract voting has been proven viable on DeFi platforms like UniSwap and in the general sense by existing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.</p>
<h1>4. Realization</h1>
<p>The driving concepts behind FairShare attribution are well-established within the blockchain domain. FairShare is comprised of existing techniques, but arranged in a different way in pursuit of <em>permanent, unbreakable, blockchain attribution for proprietary purposes</em>.</p>
