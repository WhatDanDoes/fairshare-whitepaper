<h1>What is FairShare?</h1>
<p>FairShare is a concept enabled by blockchain technology. Though the technology may seem complicated, the idea is simple: when you contribute to a project, you get to keep a piece of what you put in.</p>
<p>As with any project, there will be people who invest money and people who invest time. Whatever your contribution, you will own your <em>FairShare</em>.</p>
<h1>What projects work with FairShare?</h1>
<p>A <em>project</em> can be anything - a business, a house, a movie... the FairShare idea works wherever people work together.</p>
<h1>FairShare is a new way to collaborate</h1>
<p>Pretend you're an author and you just finished your first novel. All your friends and family love it. It'll be a bestseller for sure!</p>
<p>Most people will have heard of <em>royalties</em>, which is money given to musicians whenever their song is downloaded. You may also know about <em>stock options</em>, which are sometimes offered to a company's employees. In both cases, the people who wrote the song or built the product can show they own a piece of the work they did in the past. They may even make money from their work long after the work is done.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if everyone could do this?</p>
<h1>FairShare is a new way to do work</h1>
<h1>FairShare is a new way to do business</h1>
<p>Let's pretend that you wanted to start a new business. Say there's an empty storefront in your neighbourhood that would be perfect for a candy store. It's a great location right next to a school. Not only will hundreds of children pass by your shop everyday, you know that parents will appreciate the inexpensive novelties that make good birthday presents.</p>
<h1>FairShare is the difference between a community <em>taking ownership</em> of a project and <em>owning</em> a project.</h1>
