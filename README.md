FairShare: Blockchain Proof of Attribution
==========================================

[fairshare.company](https://fairshare.company)

> **Abstract:** Removing _trust_ in collaborative creative projects by means of Blockchain technology ensures individual participants receive permanent attribution for their contribution to the overall work. Once a contribution is accepted, credit is paid out to the contributor in the form of crypto tokens. These tokens may be used to facilitate smart-contract micropayments or to enforce proprietary rights, as in a court of law. The possession of digital keys, as they pertain to all common crypto accounts, prove token ownership. Anyone owning a stake in a digital project has the free discretion to market their tokens and any smart-contract royalties to which they may be entitled. The permanent nature of a blockchain makes it the ideal platform for encoding attribution rights over a digital property.

# 1. Introduction

The concept of digital attribution on the blockchain is not new. Major smart-contract-capable blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Cardano have already deployed specialized _Non-Fungible Tokens_. NFTs are a popular way to allow digitial creators and their fans the opportunity to sell and trade unique, signed pieces of digital art. By themselves, NFTs satisfy the need to prove ownership and attribution. Even the idea of a collaborative blockchain platform is not unique, as evidenced by tokens like _GitCoin_, which permanently attributes contributions made to open-source projects.

The concept of _FairShare_ attribution is unique in that it helps prove proprietary rights while leveraging existing software and platforms to facilitate creative collaboration. In recognition of a contribution, payment is made in the form of _FairShares_, which are platform-specific tokens that entitle the holder to certain rights, enforced by smart-contract where possible. These rights include the ability to withdraw royalty payments in proportion to the total number of FairShares issued in development of a project, or to assert legal ownership of a digital work in a human court.

# 2. Digital Works

For the purposes of this white paper, discussion will revolve around works of literature, though the FairShare platform is not constrained to this medium. _Any_ digital product can be produced, though books and book publishing are sufficiently complex to draw out important points of discussion.

Though a book is commonly attributed to one author, this is not always the case. Similarly, though a group of individuals may author a book, credit is also due to those who add value to its publication like editors, cover designers, and the financial backing that might come from investors or traditional publishing houses. A digital work may be _possessed_ by one person who then may decide to transfer ownership of the associated NFT. In this case, the contributions of all those involved will still be recognized. If entitled to royalties, they will still be able to withdraw that to which they are entitled.

Access to a digital work may be granted by minting new NFTs. If an NFT is excessively large, access may be granted through specialized NFTs which decode a digitial stream for the token holder. The manner in which digital work is consumed is decided by its owner. Likewise, access may be granted to project contributors or even purchased with FairShares, regardless of whether they are associated with that particular project.

# 3. FairShares

_FairShares_ are the native token of the FairShare platform. Projects vary in size and scope, so there is no upper limit to the number of tokens that might be issued. This is so that there is no limit to the number of people allowed to participate. While book publishing may be complex, it is helpful to contrast the number of people that may be required to produce a video game or movie. Organized to maximize collaboration in this way, development on an artistic franchise may potentially continue while still respecting the work of the original creators. Book series like the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are an example of such a franchise, which, if deployed on the FairShare platform, would entitle the creator's estate to an ongoing share of the royalties through a smart contract rather than a legal firm.

FairShares may entitle the holder access to a digital work, though this is not necessarily true. Access is decided by an NFT's creator or by a vote, where each FairShare provides one ballot. Smart contract voting has been proven viable on DeFi platforms like UniSwap and in the general sense by existing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.

# 4. Realization

The driving concepts behind FairShare attribution are well-established within the blockchain domain. FairShare is comprised of existing techniques, but arranged in a different way in pursuit of _permanent, unbreakable, blockchain attribution for proprietary purposes_.
